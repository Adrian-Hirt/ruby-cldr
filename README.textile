h1. Ruby library for exporting data from CLDR 

CLDR ("Common Locale Data Repository":http://cldr.unicode.org) contains tons of high-quality locale data such as formatting rules for dates, times, numbers, currencies as well as language, country, calendar-specific names etc.

For localizing applications in Ruby we'll obviously be able to use this incredibly comprehensive and well-maintained resource.

This library is a first stab at that goal. You can export CLDR data to YAML and Ruby formatted files which are supposed to be usable in an  "I18n":http://github.com/svenfuchs/i18n context but might be usable elsewhere,  too.

h2. Requirements

* Ruby 1.9 (if you want well-ordered Hashes)
* Thor

h2. Usage

This will export all known components from all locales to the target directory ./data/[locale]/[component].{yml,rb}:

	$ thor cldr:export

You can also optionally specify locales and/or components to export as well as the target directory:

	$ thor cldr:export --locales de fr en --components numbers plurals --target=./tmp/export

This will export the components :numbers and :plurals from the locales :de, :fr and :en to the same target directory.
