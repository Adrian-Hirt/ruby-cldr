Current merge strategy does not work because of aliases that point from :root
to e.g. :de (and then might fall back from :de to :root again).

Plan:

+ always merge in :root (done)
+ resolve an alias xpath to a yaml key (done)
- resolve keys if :merge => true



- DateTime format needs to use {0} {1} cldr format
- make sense of timezone data
- hook into Rails' select_month and DateTime helpers

extract:

- territoryContainment (groups territories)
- languageData (maps languages/scripts to territories)
- territoryInfo (?)
- calendarData
- weekData

what do the following tags in supplementalMetadata mean?
- variable
- defaultContent
