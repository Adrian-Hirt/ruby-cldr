- figure out rules to extract default keys for calendars
	-> defaults seem to be defined in root.xml and then overwritten in very few
	   locales (grep for "<default")

- currency, date + time formatters
- hook into I18n.localize


extract:

- territoryContainment (groups territories)
- languageData (maps languages/scripts to territories)
- territoryInfo (?)
- calendarData
- weekData

what do the following tags in supplementalMetadata mean?
- variable
- defaultContent
